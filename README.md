TODO: Secure Backend for API Key
This project currently uses the OpenAI API key directly in the frontend for simplicity.

In production, a secure Node.js backend (or serverless function) should be used to:

Store your OpenAI API key privately

Act as a proxy between the frontend and OpenAI

Prevent exposing secrets to the client

âœ… A backend version is planned for future updates.
